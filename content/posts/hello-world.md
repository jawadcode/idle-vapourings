Greetings earthlings, welcome to my blog.

## Background:

This is the culmination of multiple weeks of procrastinating, bikeshedding, and
toying with the idea of implementing my own blog-oriented SSG and ultimately
giving up once I recalled [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) exists.

## What sort of content should I expect?

I don't have any plans in particular about the type of content I will post on
here, other than it being within the bounds of STEM (unless my mind decides to
wander elsewhere, which it tends to do). My current topics of interest are, in
no particular order:

* Compiler development:
  * Type systems and methods of Type Inference
  * Intermediate Representations (yet to explore)
  * Bytecode Compilation and VMs
  * Optimisation (yet to explore)
  * Codegen (yet to explore)
* Functional programming:
  * How it relates to type systems (related to compiler development)
  * Algebraic Effects and other methods of encoding side-effects in the
  type-system (also related to compiler development)
* Pure maths:
  * Currently reading "Proofs: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook" by Jay Cummings
  * I'd like to explore abstract algebra, I've looked into category theory a
  fair amount due to it's overlap with functional programming
  * I'm fairly low on the scale of mathematical maturity so this list is ever
  growing
